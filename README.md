The CRM system is built upon a robust architecture that incorporates key technologies to ensure flexibility, modularity, and efficiency. At its core is the Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, providing a structured framework for developing scalable and maintainable web applications. This architectural pattern separates the application into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and manages flow).

In terms of data persistence and interaction with the database, the system utilizes JPA (Java Persistence API). JPA is a Java specification for managing relational data in Java applications, providing a standard way to map Java objects to relational databases. The integration of JPA ensures a streamlined and object-oriented approach to database interactions, enhancing the system's maintainability and reducing the complexity of database-related code.

Additionally, the project leverages various Spring technologies to complement the Spring MVC architecture. Spring MVC facilitates the development of clean and modular code, while other Spring modules, such as Spring Security, may be employed to enhance authentication and authorization processes, reinforcing the system's overall security posture.

The combination of Spring MVC, JPA, and other Spring modules creates a well-rounded and powerful foundation for the CRM system. This architecture not only supports the system's current functionality but also allows for scalability and adaptability, ensuring that the CRM can evolve to meet future business requirements and technological advancements.
